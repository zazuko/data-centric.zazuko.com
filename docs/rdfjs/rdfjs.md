title: RDF/JS

RDF/JS is a set of W3C community specifications which give developers a common denominator
for any code which access and processes RDF data. There are four specs:

1. [Data Model](https://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/)
1. [Dataset](https://rdf.js.org/dataset-spec/)
1. [Streams](https://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/)
1. [Query](https://rdf.js.org/query-spec/)

In practice, there are a number of challenges developers face when trying to take advantage of
libraries: the specs are pretty low-level and streaming in nature, and highly fragmented with
numerous small tools which need to be brought together. 

In the RDF/JS section we show how to be productive using our favourite libraries and to
achieve practical goals.
