# Data-Centric APIs

Data-centric APIs are designed to provide a structured and standardized way to access and
manipulate data. Unlike traditional APIs that focus on specific functionalities or services,
data-centric APIs emphasize the data itself, making it easier to integrate, query, and manage data
across different systems. These APIs often leverage semantic web technologies, such as RDF and SPARQL,
to enable rich data interactions and ensure interoperability between diverse data sources.

## Kopflos

[Kopflos](./kopflos) is Zazuko's data-centric API platform that provides a flexible solution for managing and
exposing data as APIs. The name, "Kopflos," is a German word that means "headless," reflecting the
platform's focus on data rather than presentation. However, Kopflos is flexible enough to accommodate
various data models and use cases, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, full-featured
websites using the latest Web technologies.
