# Kopflos

[Kopflos](https://github.com/zazuko/kopflos/) is Data-Centric API. Named "headless", it focuses on 
RDF data and SPARQL but is flexible enough to accommodate various data models and use cases.

Some key principles of Kopflos are:

1. Provide a structured and standardized way to access and manipulate data.
2. Emphasizes the data itself, making it easier to integrate, query, and manage data across different systems.
3. Embed the API description in the data itself.

Make sure to follow the [Getting Started](./tutorials/gettings-started.md) guide to learn your first steps with Kopflos.
