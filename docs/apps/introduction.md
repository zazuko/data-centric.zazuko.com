A data-centric application is a software system primarily focused on managing, processing, and utilizing data.
In such applications, data is the central component, and the application is designed to organize, store, analyze, and present this data effectively.
The primary goal of a data-centric application is to ensure that data is easily accessible, accurate, and can be used to drive decision-making or automate processes.
Examples include database management systems, data analytics platforms, and business intelligence tools.
