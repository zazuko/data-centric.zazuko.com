## Try it out

We provide a very simple Docker Compose stack that can be used to try out Blueprint.

Just go here and follow the instructions: https://github.com/zazuko/blueprint/tree/main/stack

The stack includes the following:

- a triplestore (Fuseki)
- a Blueprint instance
- a Trifid instance

and comes with a small dataset to get you started.

The dataset contains information about a Kubernetes cluster and OCI data.
Instructions on how to generate those data for your own cluster are included in the repository.
